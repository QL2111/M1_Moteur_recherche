1	1	Why valsalva increases murmur of MVP & HOCM?	unusualCortex001	2024/01/07	https://www.reddit.com/r/Physiology/comments/190kt1d/why_valsalva_increases_murmur_of_mvp_hocm/	Whenever I think about this I never seem to fully understand. I have read about this. It says the murmur is enhanced because preload decreases.   Valsalva would reduce venous return thus decreasing preload. But less preload would mean less force of contraction of LV. This should have resulted in diminished murmur of HOCM & MVP also. I don't understand it.  Kindly consider answering.	Reddit

3	3	Afterload and vasovagal syncope	Stiley34	2024/01/04	https://www.reddit.com/r/Physiology/comments/18yczrs/afterload_and_vasovagal_syncope/	I understand that maneuvers such as crossing legs or handgrip prevent vasovagal syncope.   1. These help by directly increasing BP by constriction of arteries/arterioles and also by increasing venous return (more preload, more cardiac output, yada yada). Is this right?  2. At the same time, these maneuvers increase afterload. This would decrease cardiac output which is already low in vasovagal syncope. Is it fair to say that this is true, but these effects are overrode by the effects talked about above?	Reddit

Is this bad? What will happen if I go on with it? Sitting normally doesn't feel good or to boring, I like to have my leg muscles more tense. Is there an alternative? Or better version of what I do?   All tips are welcome, thank you!!	Reddit

8	8	Mitral valve stenosis vs. aortic valve stenosis	JayRay_77	2023/12/30	https://www.reddit.com/r/Physiology/comments/18um04h/mitral_valve_stenosis_vs_aortic_valve_stenosis/	Hello everyone Im a medstudent in my 3rd year from switzerland and I have invested quite some time now in trying to understand, when a dilation happens and when hypertrophy happens in the heart.  A rule I found is:  More volume burden = dilation (aortic valve insufficiency causes LV dilation)  more pressure burden = hypertrophy of the myocardium (aortic valve stenosis)  So why doesnt an mitral stenosis cause a LA hypertrophy but an aortic valve stenosis causes an LV hypertrophy.  Thank you very much.	Reddit

  Disentangling"	['Xuesong Niu', 'Zitong Yu', 'Hu Han', 'Xiaobai Li', 'Shiguang Shan', 'Guoying Zhao']	2020/07/16	[{'@href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08213v1', '@rel': 'alternate', '@type': 'text/html'}, {'@title': 'pdf', '@href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08213v1', '@rel': 'related', '@type': 'application/pdf'}]	Remote physiological measurements, e.g., remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) based heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and respiration frequency (RF) measuring, are playing more and more important roles under the application scenarios where contact measurement is inconvenient or impossible. Since the amplitude of the physiological signals is very small, they can be easily affected by head movements, lighting conditions, and sensor diversities. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-verified feature disentangling strategy to disentangle the physiological features with non-physiological representations, and then use the distilled physiological features for robust multi-task physiological measurements. We first transform the input face videos into a multi-scale spatial-temporal map (MSTmap), which can suppress the irrelevant background and noise features while retaining most of the temporal characteristics of the periodic physiological signals. Then we take pairwise MSTmaps as inputs to an autoencoder architecture with two encoders (one for physiological signals and the other for non-physiological information) and use a cross-verified scheme to obtain physiological features disentangled with the non-physiological features. The disentangled features are finally used for the joint prediction of multiple physiological signals like average HR values and rPPG signals. Comprehensive experiments on different large-scale public datasets of multiple physiological measurement tasks as well as the cross-database testing demonstrate the robustness of our approach.	Arxiv

  physiological function"	['Amir Bashan', 'Ronny P. Bartsch', 'Jan W. Kantelhardt', 'Shlomo Havlin', 'Plamen Ch. Ivanov']	2012/03/01	[{'@title': 'doi', '@href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1705', '@rel': 'related'}, {'@href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0242v1', '@rel': 'alternate', '@type': 'text/html'}, {'@title': 'pdf', '@href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0242v1', '@rel': 'related', '@type': 'application/pdf'}]	The human organism is an integrated network where complex physiologic systems, each with its own regulatory mechanisms, continuously interact, and where failure of one system can trigger a breakdown of the entire network. Identifying and quantifying dynamical networks of diverse systems with different types of interactions is a challenge. Here, we develop a framework to probe interactions among diverse systems, and we identify a physiologic network. We find that each physiologic state is characterized by a specific network structure, demonstrating a robust interplay between network topology and function. Across physiologic states the network undergoes topological transitions associated with fast reorganization of physiologic interactions on time scales of a few minutes, indicating high network flexibility in response to perturbations. The proposed system-wide integrative approach may facilitate the development of a new field, Network Physiology.	Arxiv

  Higher-Order SVD for Long-Term Post-Operative Pain Prediction"	['Raheleh Baharloo', 'Jose C. Principe', 'Parisa Rashidi', 'Patrick J. Tighe']	2021/09/02	[{'@href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00888v1', '@rel': 'alternate', '@type': 'text/html'}, {'@title': 'pdf', '@href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00888v1', '@rel': 'related', '@type': 'application/pdf'}]	Long-term pain conditions after surgery and patients' responses to pain relief medications are not yet fully understood. While recent studies developed an index for nociception level of patients under general anesthesia, based on multiple physiological parameters, it remains unclear whether and how dynamics of these parameters indicate long-term post-operative pain (POP). To extract unbiased and interpretable descriptions of how physiological parameters dynamics change over time and across patients in response to surgical procedures, we employed a multivariate-temporal analysis. We demonstrate the main features of intra-operative physiological responses can be used to predict long-term POP. We propose to use a complex higher-order SVD method to accurately decompose the patients' physiological responses into multivariate structures evolving in time. We used intra-operative vital signs of 175 patients from a mixed surgical cohort to extract three interconnected, low-dimensional complex-valued descriptions of patients' physiological responses: multivariate factors, reflecting sub-physiological parameters; temporal factors reflecting common intra-surgery temporal dynamics; and patients factors, describing patient to patient changes in physiological responses. Adoption of complex-HOSVD allowed us to clarify the dynamic correlation structure included in intra-operative physiological responses. Instantaneous phases of the complex-valued physiological responses within the subspace of principal descriptors enabled us to discriminate between mild versus severe levels of long-term POP. By abstracting patients into different surgical groups, we identified significant surgery-related principal descriptors: each of them potentially encodes different surgical stimulation. The dynamics of patients' physiological responses to these surgical events are linked to long-term post-operative pain development.	Arxiv

  Physiological Response: A Review"	['Seong-Eun Moon', 'Jong-Seok Lee']	2018/09/12	[{'@title': 'doi', '@href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2016.2614880', '@rel': 'related'}, {'@href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04254v1', '@rel': 'alternate', '@type': 'text/html'}, {'@title': 'pdf', '@href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04254v1', '@rel': 'related', '@type': 'application/pdf'}]	The exponential growth of popularity of multimedia has led to needs for user-centric adaptive applications that manage multimedia content more effectively. Implicit analysis, which examines users' perceptual experience of multimedia by monitoring physiological or behavioral cues, has potential to satisfy such demands. Particularly, physiological signals categorized into cerebral physiological signals (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy) and peripheral physiological signals (heart rate, respiration, skin temperature, etc.) have recently received attention along with notable development of wearable physiological sensors. In this paper, we review existing studies on physiological signal analysis exploring perceptual experience of multimedia. Furthermore, we discuss current trends and challenges.	Arxiv

  eusocial insects"	['Daniel A Friedman', 'Brian R Johnson', 'Timothy Linksvayer']	2019/11/04	[{'@href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01321v1', '@rel': 'alternate', '@type': 'text/html'}, {'@title': 'pdf', '@href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01321v1', '@rel': 'related', '@type': 'application/pdf'}]	The traditional focus of physiological and functional genomic research is on molecular processes that play out within a single body. In contrast, when social interactions occur, molecular and behavioral responses in interacting individuals can lead to physiological processes that are distributed across multiple individuals. In eusocial insect colonies, such multi-body processes are tightly integrated, involving social communication mechanisms that regulate the physiology of colony members. As a result, conserved physiological mechanisms, for example related to pheromone detection and neural signaling pathways, are deployed in novel contexts and regulate emergent colony traits during the evolutionary origin and elaboration of social complexity. Here we review conceptual frameworks for organismal and colony physiology, and highlight functional genomic, physiological, and behavioral research exploring how colony-level traits arise from physical and chemical interactions among nestmates. We highlight mechanistic work exploring how colony traits arise from physical and chemical interactions among physiologically-specialized nestmates of various developmental stages. We consider similarities and differences between organismal and colony physiology, and make specific predictions based on a decentralized perspective on the function and evolution of colony traits. Integrated models of colony physiological function will be useful to address fundamental questions related to the evolution and ecology of collective behavior in natural systems.	Arxiv

We first describe a taxonomy framing how physiological signals can be used to drive interactive systems both as input and output. We then propose applications to interactive storytelling and describe the implementation of a software tool to create Physiological Interactive Fiction (PIF). The results of an online study (N=140) provided guidelines towards augmenting the reading experience. PIF was then evaluated in a lab study (N=14) to determine how physiological signals can be used to infer a reader's state. Our results show that breathing, electrodermal activity, and eye tracking can help differentiate positive from negative tones, and monotonous from exciting events. This work demonstrates how PIF can support storytelling in creating engaging content and experience tailored to the reader. Moreover, it opens the space to future physiologically driven systems within broader application areas.	Arxiv

While anatomical imaging is based on well-established principles of photography, physiological optical imaging is a relatively novel range of technologies that requires considering a new set of technical and physiological aspects. We discuss several factors (binning, spatial frequency sampling, and distance to the target area) indispensable to getting quantifiable and reproducible results, which are the essence of physiological imaging. We also discussed their implications for several commonly used physiological imaging modalities, including hyperspectral/multispectral imaging, fluorescence imaging, and thermography. Physiological imaging technologies are in their infancy. Thus, the proper design, which considers technical and physiological aspects, is paramount to establishing their credibility and driving clinical adoption.	Arxiv

  Systematic Review"	['Dongrui Wu', 'Jiaxin Xu', 'Weili Fang', 'Yi Zhang', 'Liuqing Yang', 'Xiaodong Xu', 'Hanbin Luo', 'Xiang Yu']	2021/02/04	[{'@href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02729v4', '@rel': 'alternate', '@type': 'text/html'}, {'@title': 'pdf', '@href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02729v4', '@rel': 'related', '@type': 'application/pdf'}]	Physiological computing uses human physiological data as system inputs in real time. It includes, or significantly overlaps with, brain-computer interfaces, affective computing, adaptive automation, health informatics, and physiological signal based biometrics. Physiological computing increases the communication bandwidth from the user to the computer, but is also subject to various types of adversarial attacks, in which the attacker deliberately manipulates the training and/or test examples to hijack the machine learning algorithm output, leading to possible user confusion, frustration, injury, or even death. However, the vulnerability of physiological computing systems has not been paid enough attention to, and there does not exist a comprehensive review on adversarial attacks to them. This paper fills this gap, by providing a systematic review on the main research areas of physiological computing, different types of adversarial attacks and their applications to physiological computing, and the corresponding defense strategies. We hope this review will attract more research interests on the vulnerability of physiological computing systems, and more importantly, defense strategies to make them more secure.	Arxiv

Physiologically adaptive systems detecting user's states can drive interaction and address these limitations. Here, we highlight potential usability and interaction limitations in MR and how physiologically adaptive systems can benefit MR experiences and applications. We specifically address potential applications for human factors and operational settings such as healthcare, education, and entertainment. We further discuss benefits and applications in light of ethical and privacy concerns. The use of physiologically adaptive systems in MR has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interactions and provide users with a more personalized and engaging experience.	Arxiv
